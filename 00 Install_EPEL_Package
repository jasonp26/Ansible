Before you can install Ansible on a Centos7 OS you need to prepare the system to be able to install it.

You need to install the EPEL Package.  (http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL#How_can_I_use_these_extra_packages.3F)

###Centos07 Command###

You need to run this command to install EPEL

sudo yum install epel-release
